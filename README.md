## About the Project

This repo is for the graded project in the 'HTML and CSS in depth' course. This course is number 4 of 9 in the Front-End Developer Certificate provided by Meta, through the Coursera website.

The goal for this project is to develop a homepage for one of four fictional companies provided by the course.

I have chosen the Lucky Shrub company. Below is the company description copied provided by the course:

>Based in Tuscon, Arizona, Lucky Shrub is a medium-sized garden design firm that specializes in garden design and creation, maintenance and landscaping. The company also runs a small plant nursery that sells indoor and outdoor plants, making them a one-stop shop for clients to "transform any space into an oasis you can be proud of".

>Lucky Shrub was started by a husband and wife team, Jason and Maria, who share a long-time love for plants. Jason is the garden architect. He creates and oversees all designs while managing his team of landscapers. Maria manages all the marketing for the company and oversees the nursery.

## Project Details and Criteria

The guidelines for the project doesn't mention the use of JavaScript, libraries or frameworks - so I will not be using any for this project.

The homepage needs to meet certain criteria regarding the following: 
 - Visual layout
 - Semantic structure
 - CSS layout
 - CSS styling
 - CSS effects

This project is a peer-reviewed assignment, and will be evaluated by others participating in the course.
